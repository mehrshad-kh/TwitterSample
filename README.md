# TwitterSample
This is a collection of Twitter samples, comprising [Twitter Server][1] and [Twitter Client][2].

Both projects are written purely in Java. The [gRPC][6] framework has been used to establish the client-server connection.

Both projects were done as part of the Advanced Programming course we took at [Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)][3].
